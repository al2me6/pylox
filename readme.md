# `pylox`

Yet another implementation of the [Lox language](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) by Bob Nystrom, written in type-annotated Python 3.8.

This is a work-in-progress.

The implementation here is largely based on Bob's AST-walking `jlox`, with some of my own changes and additions.
